<p>There are many innocent sounding questions about primes... that are really hard to answer!</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Are there infinitely many pairs of primes whose difference is 2?</em> &nbsp; (Nobody knows!)</p>
<p>It easy to search for such pairs using Sage, and if you try the code below you'll be quickly convinced about what the answer <em><strong>should be</strong></em>. &nbsp; &nbsp;But nobody knows for sure, despite many, many people attempting to find a proof!</p>

{{{id=6|
for p in prime_range(1000):
    if (p+2).is_prime():
        print (p, p+2),         # comma so no newline
///
}}}

<p>You an ask the same question, but with 4, 6, 8, or any even number instead of 2. &nbsp;Nobody knows the answer. &nbsp;You can also try to use Sage to figure out what the answer "should be". Try now.</p>

{{{id=4|

///
}}}

<p><strong>Question: </strong>Are there infinitely many primes that are 1 more than a perfect square, i.e., of the form $n^2 + 1$?</p>
<p>&nbsp;Again, nobody knows (!), yet if you try computing with Sage you'll quickly form an <em><strong>opinion</strong></em>.</p>

{{{id=3|
for n in [1..100]:
    if (n^2+1).is_pseudoprime():
        print n^2+1,
///
}}}

{{{id=2|

///
}}}

<p><strong>Question:</strong><em> Are there infinitely many Mersenne primes $2^p-1$?</em> &nbsp;Nobody knows!</p>

{{{id=13|

///
}}}

<p>Asking interesting questions about the mathematics you study is a high are, and an essential skill to acquire in order to get the most enjoyment---and understanding---from mathematics. &nbsp;So your <em><strong>homework</strong></em> for tonight is to come up with your question about primes that:</p>
<ul>
<li>is interesting to you,</li>
<li>is not a question whose answer is known to you,</li>
<li>is not a question that you've seen before; or at least not exactly,</li>
<li>is a question about which you can begin to make numerical investigations (in fact, do so if you can).</li>
</ul>
<p>We will share our questions at the beginning tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>
