Day 8:  How are the number of points mod p distributed?

<p>In the previous worksheet we fixed an elliptic curve $E: y^2=x^3+ax+b$ and considered the numbers $\#E({\rm F}_p)$ for many $p$. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The <em><strong>heuristic idea</strong></em>&nbsp;behind the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture is: $E(\QQ)$ should have positive rank (i.e., be really big) if and only if the numbers&nbsp;$\#E({\rm F}_p)$ tend to be big.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you see a bunch of numbers, the statistician in you might want to plot how they are <strong>distributed</strong>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, if you see a bunch of test scores, you might plot a frequency histrogram. &nbsp;Likewise, if you had data about a bunch of people's weights or heights you might plot a frequency histogram. &nbsp;The result might look like a "bell curve", and you could tease out optimal parameters for that curve by computing the mean and standard deviation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The numbers&nbsp;$\#E({\rm F}_p)$ just keep getting bigger and bigger as we measure them for each prime. &nbsp;However, recall the Hasse bound:</p>
<p>$$|p+1 - \#E({\rm F}_p)| \leq 2\sqrt{p}.$$</p>
<p>Now look what happens when we divide by $2\sqrt{p}$. &nbsp;We get numbers</p>
<p>$$b_p = \frac{p+1 - \#E({\rm F}_p)}{2\sqrt{p}},$$</p>
<p>and the above inequality becomes $|b_p| \leq 1$. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus given an elliptic curve $E$, we obtain an infinite sequence $b_p$ of "measurements", each one being a real number in the interval $[-1,1]$.</p>
<p>What does the frequency histogram look like?</p>

<p>Any guesses about what this is?</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it a normal distribution (i.e., the bell curve)?</li>
<li>???</li>
</ul>
<p>Can you find any elliptic curves where things look dramatically different?&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <strong>Sato-Tate conjecture</strong>&nbsp;gave a guess at an answer to this question. &nbsp;The conjecture was recently <em><strong>completely proved</strong></em>&nbsp;mainly by Richard Taylor.</p>
